Drive Uploader

This script requires the use of jsTree (http://www.jstree.com/) a javascript library that displays 
XML data in a tree structure with support for icons, search and javascript controls. Using the script,
which uploads XML files of the structure of drives to a folder on a FTP, the jsTree can reiterate 
through this folder using a few simple bits of PHP.

This system makes searching for files across several different offline drives much easier but the 
downside is that the rendering of the XML upon every new reload of the page can become slow with many
large drives (large XML files) being rendered.
